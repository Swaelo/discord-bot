This is the base part of my discord bot project, it only has a single `*help` function which I have added as an example to show how the command module system works.  
Any other functionality required can be done by adding additional modules to the bot, I will give an example of how to do this in the very near future.  
You should expect to see a seperate repo for the music playing module to appear on my page soon, when that has been completed I will give an indepth explanation here on how to add that module to the bot.
