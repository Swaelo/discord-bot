Node.JS is required and can be downloaded from nodejs.org  
**How to use**  
1. Clone this repo somewhere to your computer
2. Open your terminal to the root directory of wherever you put the files
3. Use the NPM packet manager to install the discord.js library in the same directory `npm install discord.js`
4. Head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), select your application and copy your token from the Bot section of your application settings.  
5. Open the auth.json file, and replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with the token you copied in the previous step, save the file
